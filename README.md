# Longest Common Prefix Tool

This is a web tool that helps find the longest common prefix among multiple strings. The tool is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

git clone https://github.com/CharithaSaranga/longest-common-prefix-tool.git

2. Open the index.html file in a web browser.

3. Enter the strings for which you want to find the longest common prefix in the input fields.

4. Click the "Add Input Field" button to add more input fields if needed.

5. Click the "Find Longest Common Prefix" button to calculate and display the result.

6. If you want to clear the input fields and the result, click the "Reset" button.


## Implementation Details

The JavaScript code implements the longestCommonPrefix function, which finds the longest common prefix among the given strings.

The tool dynamically adds input fields using the "Add Input Field" button, allowing users to enter multiple strings.

The comparison for finding the longest common prefix is case-insensitive, meaning it considers strings with different cases (lower or upper).

The "Find Longest Common Prefix" button triggers the calculation and displays the result in the designated area.

The "Reset" button clears the input fields and the result, allowing users to start afresh.
